James Bach: "Beauty or Bugs: Using the Blink Oracle in Testing"

1/ A test is not a thing, it is a human experience
2/ Key heuristic of Exploratory test design
Detach yourself from "pass" and "fail"
Instead ask "What problems can I see"
Because focusing on signs of problems, in an open-ended way, helpd maximisze 
the probability of finding them (especially problems you disn't anticipate)
3/ Oracle-related Heuristics to keep in mind
* A trigger heuristic 
* A radiator heuristic
* A decider Heuristic 
* An oracle is a heuristic for recognizing a bug when you encounter it
* Sensemaking is a huge part of testing
* Magic can happen when you encounter data that is overwhelming for your senses
* A blink oracle is an oracle wherein a tester encounters a radiator of overwhelming information and reacts to it
* A mechanical oracle is one based on a algorithmic procedure, independant of human reaction
* The mix of the two is interesting
* Forms of blinks: Zoom blinks, Speed blinks, Flip blinks, Audio blinks (challenging to realize)
* Blink oracles heuristics: educate the intuition, overwhelm the senses, ugliness is bugliness
