James Bach: "Beauty or Bugs: Using the Blink Oracle in Testing"

1/ A test is not a thing, it is a human experience
2/ Key heuristic of Exploratory test design
Detach yourself from "pass" and "fail"
Instead ask "What problems can I see"
Because focusing on signs of problems, in an open-ended way, helpd maximisze 
the probability of finding them (especially problems you disn't anticipate)
3/ Oracle-related Heuristics to keep in mind
* A trigger heuristic 
* A radiator heuristic
* A decider Heuristic 
* An oracle is a heuristic for recognizing a bug when you encounter it
